# echo_dot-BMW

I tried to pair my echo dot with my BMW's bluetooth soundsystem and realized that echo dot can not verify the pairing
code BMW's sound system requires

is there any way to pair the dot by changing the settings of it? Or adding something to the programming of it?

i dont want to use the audio jack to connect to the system
